## Why this list?

Financial data APIs are everywhere, but finding ones with genuinely usable free tiers is surprisingly hard. Most "free" offerings bury rate limits, hide asset coverage gaps, or require enterprise contracts for anything beyond a demo. This list cuts through the noise.

**Who this is for:**

- **Fintech developers** building MVPs or prototypes.
- **Quants & algo traders** who need data for backtesting without a Bloomberg terminal.
- **Data scientists** exploring financial datasets.
- **Students & hobbyists** learning about markets programmatically.

## How to use this list

Each entry follows a consistent format:

- **Name** — linked to docs or homepage.
- **Description** — what the API provides, in one sentence.
- **Best for** — the primary use case where it shines.
- **Free tier** — what you get without paying.
- **Limitations** — constraints worth knowing upfront.

## Caveats & Compliance

Before building anything production-grade with free-tier data, keep these in mind:

- **Data quality varies.** Free-tier data may be delayed, adjusted differently, or have gaps. Always validate against a trusted source before making financial decisions.
- **Rate limits are real.** Exceeding free-tier limits will get you throttled or banned. Build in backoff and caching from day one.
- **Licensing matters.** Some APIs restrict commercial use on free tiers. Read the terms of service — "free" doesn't always mean "free to monetize."
- **Exchange data agreements.** Redistribution of real-time exchange data (NYSE, NASDAQ, CME, etc.) typically requires exchange agreements regardless of your data vendor's pricing.
- **Not financial advice.** This list is a developer resource. Nothing here constitutes investment advice, and API data should not be the sole basis for trading decisions.
- **Regulatory considerations.** If you're building for end users, be aware of regulations in your jurisdiction (MiFID II, Reg NMS, GDPR for PII in banking APIs, etc.).

## Roadmap / Ideas

Things that could make this list even better — PRs welcome:

- [ ] **SDK code samples** — Minimal working examples (Python, JavaScript, Go) for each API.
- [ ] **Comparison tables** — Side-by-side feature matrix for overlapping APIs (e.g., all equity data providers).
- [ ] **Uptime & latency tracking** — Community-sourced reliability data for each API.
- [ ] **Machine-readable list** — JSON/YAML version in `data/` for programmatic consumption.
- [ ] **Authentication guide** — Common patterns (API key, OAuth, WebSocket auth) across providers.
- [ ] **Rate-limit cheat sheet** — Quick-reference table of all free-tier limits.
- [ ] **Dead link checker** — GitHub Action to periodically validate all URLs.
